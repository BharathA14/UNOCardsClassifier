# UNOCardsClassifier

This project classifies UNO cards. You can approach this using two approaches:<br>
 <&nbsp;>1.Multi-Class Classification Problem.<br>
 <&nbsp;>2.Multi-label Classification Problem.<br>
This project is created using the scecond approach. The model is custom made, using tensorflow and Keras API.<br>
The Dataset for this project is custom made , due to lack of datasets. Only a single image for each card is taken and training images
using image augmentation techniques. About 800 images were used for training.
